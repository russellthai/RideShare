There are around 8 people when I had 20 cars
to pick up the 50 passengers

There are around 22 people when I had 40 cars 
to pick up the 50 passengers

I got an overall higher percentage of passengers
that made it to their final location when I had 
more cars which logically makes sense when I 
ran the simulation

To do this project, I created a person and car 
class which served as my primary backbones

Then I also used a station class where I could 
do the first part where I had to add people to 
the stations so that they could be picked up

Then all the heavy lifting was done in the road 
class.
That is where I had the cars picking up the people.

Then my tester file was very light.


I think this project was very good for my understadning.
I learned a lot from this frustrating but rewarding process
While the project might not be perfect, I am very
proud that I got to as close as I could with the 
help of Mr. Rosato
I am really proud of the roadbumps I overcame 
like truly understanding what a null pointer exception
error is or the something as simple as fixing typos
